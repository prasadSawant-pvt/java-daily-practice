# Java Daily Automation

This repository focuses on solving Java programming problems regularly, along with writing basic unit tests using JUnit.

---

## 🔄 Purpose

* Solve core Java problems and interview-style challenges
* Practice clean code and TDD (Test-Driven Development)
* Explore GitHub Actions for automation and learning consistency

---

## 🧠 Problem Categories (Planned)

* String Manipulation
* Array & Matrix
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Sorting & Searching
* Object-Oriented Design
* Data Structures (LinkedList, Stack, Queue, etc.)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
.github/workflows/         # GitHub Actions automation logic
src/                       # Java solution files
test/                      # Corresponding JUnit test files
```

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Java 17+
* JUnit 5
* GitHub Actions
* Shell Scripting

---

## 🔁 Automation

* Auto-generates and commits one Java file and one JUnit test daily
* Uses scheduled GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/java-activity.yml`)
* Encourages consistency in coding practice

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Browse `src/` for daily Java problems.
3. Check `test/` for associated test cases.
4. Use for interview prep, practice, or learning automation.
